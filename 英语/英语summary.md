> I am writing to express my concern over the Library service on the campus. As a major in English, I find that most of the Books in English in the library are outdated.So far,I have not come across a single book published after1995. As a result, we fail to get the latest information of academic development both at home and abroad.In addition, the light in the reading room is farfrom bright, which does harm to our eyes.Worse still, there is no air-conditioning and we are sweating heavily while reading. Last but not least, the newly developed electronic information system does not work well and needs further improvement.A great number of books should have been listed in the system. There is no denying that the library has helped us a lot.But it is in urgent need of improvement. When improved, the library is certain to provide much more help with our study.

> I am writing to you to apply for the membership of the English Club. As a sophomore from the English Department,I love English literature very much.I often attend the English Corner held on Friday in the People’s University of China and would like to discuss various topics in English with others. I am eager to be one member of the English Club and improve further my English.I know there are some requirements, but I am not clear about the details. Is it necessary for me to pay for membership?If so, how much should I pay? And how often? I have also heard that the club will host various activities, but can you give me more details. I would be very grateful if you can send me a reply as soon as Possible. Looking forward to hearing from you soon

> Dear Xiao Wang,

> I am very glad to know that you are soon coming to Beijing to join me in the summer holiday.I have been looking forward to your arrival.
>
> Since you can stay in Beijing only for a week,I am afraid that you will have a tight schedule for visiting the numerous places of historic interest.My suggestion is that you first visit some famous places that you have the greatest interest in, such as the Palace Museum, the Summer Place, the Great Wall; then you can visit those places you think less important.I believe this kind of arrangement will make you have enough time to appreciate what you really want to see.Moreover if you really want to be a good traveler,I advise you to read some introductory books to these places before you come to see them with your own eyes. With more knowledge about these places, you will have a better understanding of Chinese history and culture.I am eager to meet you soon in Beijing. Wish you in advance a pleasant trip to Beijing

> Understanding when and how to apply different reading styles enables you to be an **adaptable** reader. Analytical reading is the **approach ** flexible readers use when engaging with complex or challenging material for deeper comprehension. When adopting this reading style, your pace should be slower than usual. Additionally, you should challenge yourself to fully grasp the text, often requiring multiple readings to achieve thorough understanding. At times, reading aloud can also enhance comprehension.

For those already employed, it’s worthwhile to assess whether they can effectively utilize English in their current roles.In business, **negotiation is a practical skill**. You must understand what you want, how to bargain, and where to compromise.

This proficiency benefits any business endeavor.
