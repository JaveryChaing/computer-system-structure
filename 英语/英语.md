  > 1. The Inventor of LED
  >
  >    ~~~
  >    　When Nick Holonyak set out to create a new kind of visible lighting using semiconductor alloys, his colleagues thought he was unrealistic．Today, his discovery of light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, are used in everything from DVDs to alarm clocks to airports．Dozens of his students have continued his work, developing lighting used in traffic lights and other everyday technology．On April 23, 2004, Holonyak received the $500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize at a ceremony in Washington．This marks the 1Oth year that the Lemelson-MIT Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT) has given the award to prominent inventors．“Anytime you get an award, big or little, it’s always a surprise．”Holonyak said．Holonyak, 75, was a student of John Bardeen, an inventor of the transistor, in the early 1950s. After graduate school, Holonyak worked at Ben Labs．He later went to General Electric, where he invented a switch now widely used in house dimmer switches．Later, Holonyak started 1ooking into how semiconductors could be used to generate 1ight. But while his colleagues were 1ooking at how to generate invisible light, he wanted to generate visible light. The LEDS he invented in 1962 now last about 10 times longer than incandescent bulbs, and are more environmentally friendly and cost effective．Holonyak, now a professor of electrical and computer engineering and physics at the University of Illinois, said he suspected that LEDs would become as commonplace as they are today, but didn’t realize how many uses they would have．“You don’t know in the beginning．YOU think you’re doing something important．you think it’s worth doing, but you really can’t tell what the big payoff is going to be, and when, and how．You just don’t know, ”he said．The Lemelson-MIT Program also recognized Edith Flanigen, 75, with the $100,000 Lemelson-MIT Lifetime Achievement Award for her work on a new generation of “molecular sieves, ”that can separate molecules by size．

  > 2. Skyscrapers and Environment
  >
  >    ~~~
  >    in the late 1960's, many people in north america turned their attention to environmental problems, and new steel-and-glass skyscrapers were widely criticized. ecologists pointed out that a cluster of tall buildings in a city often overburdens public transportation and parking lot capacities.
  >    skyscrapers are also lavish consumers, and wasters, of electric power. in one recent year, the addition of 17 million square feet of skyscraper office space in new york city raised the peak daily demand for electricity by 120, 000 kilowatts-enough to supply the entire city of albany, new york, for a day.
  >    glass-walled skyscrapers can be especially wasteful. the heat loss (or gain)through a wall of half-inch plate glass is more than ten times that through a typical masonry wall filled with insulation board. to lessen the strain on heating and air-conditioning equipment, builders of skyscrapers have begun to use double-glazed panels of glass, and reflective glasses coated with silver or gold mirror films that reduce glare as well as heat gain. however, mirror-walled skyscrapers raise the temperature of the surrounding air and affect neighboring buildings.
  >    skyscrapers put a severe strain on a city's sanitation facilities, too. if fully occupied, the two world trade center towers in new york city would alone generate 2.25 million gallons of raw sewage each year-as much as a city the size of stanford, connecticut , which has a population of more than 109, 000.

  >    ~~~
  >    Singapore is an independent city-state in southeastern Asia， consisting of one major island -the Singapore island-and more than 50 small islands， located off the southern tip of Malay. The city of Singapore， the capital of the country， is at the southeastern end of the Singapore Island; it is one of the most important port cities and commercial centers of Southeast Asia. The total area of the republic is 640 sq.km.
  >    Low-lying Singapore Island has no outstanding relief(轮廓鲜明的) features. A central area of hills rises to the maximum height of 176m. The country has a wet tropical climate， with an average annual temperature of 27.20°C. The average annual rainfall is 2.413 mm， the wettest months are November through January.
  >    Singapore is governed under a constitution of 1959. A president， elected to a four-year term， is head of state， and a prime minister is head of government. The president used to be selected by Parliament， but by 1991 constitutional amendment (修正案)， the president is now elected directly by the people. The Parliament is the law-making body with its 81 members popularly elected.
  >    In the late 1980s the country had some 290 primary schools with 278，300 pupils and 160 secondary schools with 200，200 students. The main institution of higher education are the National University of Singapore， several technical colleges， and a teachers college.
  >    Singapore has one of the highest standards of living of any country in Asia. In the late 1980s the gross domestic product was estimated at $23.7 billion， or $8，870 per person. The fishing industry is centered on the port of During， on southwestern Singapore Island. Industry has grown rapidly since the 1960s， and Singapore now produces a diversity(多样化的) of goods， including chemicals， electronic items， clothing， and processed foods， etc. Shipbuilding and petroleum refining are also important.

  > 4. Michael Jackson --- the Ups and Downs
  >
  >    ~~~
  >    Michael Jackson, the seventh of nine children, started his musical career with his brothers in 1964.They called themselves the Jackson Five. Michael quickly became the centre of attention. During the following years the band released hit after hit and became the most successful town group. In 1975 the Jackson Five decided to leave Motown for more money at CBS records. Young Michael began his solo（独唱）career while he was still with the group. His big breakthrough came in 1982 with the arrival of his biggest selling album, Thriller. The album had seven hit singles and became famous for its video clip. The following year Jackson married Lisa Marie Presley. In 1984 he set his hair on fire for a commercial in Los Angeles. He was injured and carried out on a stretcher（担架）. This and many other strange stories about Jackson brought him the nickname Wacko Jack(怪人杰克). Nevertheless the sales of his records went up. Black and White was the biggest hit of the 1991 album Dangerous. During the promotion of his album he invited US talk master Oprah Winfrey to Neverland（梦幻岛）. There he gave the world insights into his private life. C. He said that he was lonely. And he also admitted that he had undergone plastic surgery. In 1993 the King of Pop was accused of harassing （骚扰） children, but a settlement with the 13-year olds parents saved him from prison. The following year Jackson married Lisa Marie Presley. But unluckily, the couple separated a year and a half later. By the mid 1990s, Jackson’s popularity had started to fall. History was a collection of greatest hits plus a few new recordings. The pop star appeared at the Brit Awards to perform his number one single Earth Song, together with a group of children. A second marriage with Nurse Deborah Rowe produced a son Michael and a daughter Paris. Jackson’s downturn continued into the new millennium. It took almost 6 years to finish the album Invincible. But when it was released in 2001,it was only in the charts(排行榜) for six weeks. In March 2009 Jackson surprised the pop world by announcing were that he would go on stage one last time. A series of ten concerts, definitely his last ones, were planned for July 2009 in the 02Arena in London. But on June 25, 2009, less than a month before he was scheduled to begin a series of comeback concerts, paramedics were called to Michael Jackson’s rented home in Holby Hills near Los Angeles where they found him unconscious and not responding. They were unable to revive the “King of Pop,"and Jackson was pronounced dead at the L.A Medical Center.

  >    Where you save your money often depends on what you are saving for If you are saving to buy a CD(光盘)or to go to a concert, then probably you would keep your money somewhere in your room.
  >    
  >    　　If you are saving for a big purchase like a mountain bike or a school trip, where would you save your money?
  >    
  >    　　One place to save money is the bank Putting your money in a savings account will help your money early more money If you put your money in a piggy bank(猪形储蓄罐), one year later you’ll still have the same amount of money you put in. If you put your money in a savings account, one year later, you’ll have more money than you put in Why?
  >    
  >    　　When you keep your money in a bank, your money earns interest. Interest is the amount of money a bank pays you to use your money. The bank uses your money (and the money of other people, too)to loan money to people and businesses.
  >    
  >    　　The bank will send you a statement several times a year. A bank statement tells you how much money you have in your account. It also tells you how much interest you have earned. If you leave your money in the bank, you can watch it grow!

They find that the phones are more than a means of __communication__ (communicate)---having a mobile phone shows that they are cool and __connected__(connect). The _explosions_ (explode) around the world in mobile phone use make some health professional worried. Some doctors are _concerned_ (concern) that in the future many people may suffer health problems from the use of mobile phones. In England, there has been a serious debate about this issue. Mobile phone companies are worried about the negative 46(public) of such ideas. They say that there is no __publicity__ (prove) that mobile phones are bad for your health. On the other hand, signs of change in the issues of the brain and head can be __detected__ (detect) with modern scanning equipment. What is it that makes mobile phones __potentially__ (potential) harmful? The answer is radiation. As the discussion about their safety continues, it appears that it’s best to use mobile phones less often. Use your regular phone if you want to talk for a long time. Use your mobile phone only when you really need it. Mobile phones can be very useful and convenient, especially in emergencies. In the future, mobile phones may have a __warning__ (warn) label that says they are bad for your health. So for now, it’s wise not to use your mobile phone too often.

  > 7. They Say Ireland`s the Best
  >
  >    ~~~
  >     Ireland is the best place in the world to live in for 2005, according to a life quality ranking that appeared in Britain's Economist magazine last week.
  >                The ambitious attempt to compare happiness levels around the world is based on the principle that wealth is not the only measure of human satisfaction and well-being. The index of 111 cotmtries uses data on incomes, health, unemployment, climate, political stability, job security, gender equality as well as what the magazine calls "freedom, family and community life".
  >              Despite the bad weather, troubled health service, traffic congestion (拥挤), gender inequality,and the high cost of living. Ireland scored an impressive 8.33 points out of 10. That put it well ahead of second-place Switzerland, which managed 8.07. Zimbabwe, troubled by political insecurity and hunger, is rated the gloomiest (最差的), picking up only 3.89 points.
  >               "Although rising incomes and increased individual choices are highly valued," the report said,"some of the factors associated with modernization such as the breakdown (崩溃) in traditional institutions and family values in part take away from a positive impact." "Ireland wins because it successfully combines the most desirable elements of the new with the preservation of certain warm elements of the old, such as stable family and community life."
  >             The magazine admitted measuring quality of'life is not a straightforward thing to do, and that its findings would have their critics.
  >            No.2 on the list is Switzerland. The other nations in the top 10 are Norway, Luxembourg,Sweden, Australia, Iceland, Italy, Denmark and Spain. The UK is positioned at No.29, a much lower position chiefly because of the social and family breakdown recorded in official statistics.
  >            The US, which has the second highest per capita GDP (人均国内生产总值) after Luxembourg,took the 13th place in the survey. China was in the lower half of the league at 60th.

  > 8. Rare Fossil Recored
  >
  >    ~~~
  >    The preservation of embryos and juveniles is a rate occurrence in the fossil record. The tiny, delicate skeletons are usually scattered by scavengers or destroyed by weathering before they can be fossilized. Ichthyosaurs had a higher chance of being preserved than did terrestrial creatures because, as marine animals, they tended to live in environments less subject to erosion. Still, their fossilization required a suite of factors: a slow rate of decay of soft tissues, little scavenging by other animals, a lack of swift currents and waves to jumble and carry away small bones, and fairly rapid burial. Given these factors, some areas have become a treasury of well-preserved ichthyosaur fossils.
  >    
  >    　　The deposits at Holzmaden, Germany, present an interesting case for analysis. The ichthyosaur remains are found in black, bituminous marine shales deposited about 190 million years ago. Over the years, thousands of specimens of marine reptiles, fish and invertebrates have been recovered from these rocks. The quality of preservation is outstanding, but what is even more impressive is the number of ichthyosaur fossils containing preserved embryos. Ichthyosaurs with embryos have been reported from 6 different levels of the shale in a small area around Holzmaden, suggesting that a specific site was used by large numbers of ichthyosaurs repeatedly over time. The embryos are quite advanced in their physical development; their paddles, for example, are already well formed. One specimen is even preserved in the birth canal. In addition, the shale contains the remains of many newborns that are between 20 and 30 inches long.
  >    
  >    　　Why are there so many pregnant females and young at Holzmaden when they are so rare elsewhere? The quality of preservation is almost unmatched and quarry operations have been carried out carefully with an awareness of the value of the fossils. But these factors do not account for the interesting question of how there came to be such a concentration of pregnant ichthyosaurs in a particular place very close to their time of giving birth.

  >    ~~~
  >    ① In 1858 Americans welcomed Alaska into the Union as the 49th state, symbolizing a change of attitude that hold in 1867 , when the peninsula was purchased from Russia. Then, most Americans had little interest in 1,500,000 square kilometers "of icebergs and polar bear"-beyond Canada's western borders, far from the settled areas of the United States.
  >    
  >    ②In those sections of the state which lie above the Arctic Circle, Alaska still is a land of icebergs and polar bear. Ice buried in the earth, which is permanently frozen to a depth of 90 or more meters, From early May until early August, the midnight sun never sets on this flat, treeless region, but the sun cannot melt the icy soil more than two thirds of a meter down.
  >    
  >    ③Alaska is America's largest slate, but only about 325 ,000 people live there. According to estimates, 800, 000 hectares of its land area are fit for plowing but only about 640,000 hectares are being cultivated.
  >    
  >    ④Arctic Alaska has been the home of Eskimos for countless centuries. It is believed that the Eskimos moved there from Mongolia or Siberia, probably crossing Bering Strait, named for Vitus Bering, the Danish sea captain who discovered Alaska on his voyage for Russia in 1741. The Eskimos are the state’s earliest known inhabitants. Russian fur traders established settlements but, by the time Alaska was sold to the United States, most of the traders had departed.
  >    
  >    ⑤In 1896 gold was discovered near the Klondike River in Canada just across the Alaskan border. Thousands of Americans rushed to the region on their way to Klondike; Alaska was never completely cut off again, although even today transportation is a major problem. There are only two motor routes from the U. S. mainland, and within the state, every town has its own airfield. Planes fly passengers, mail and freight to the most distant villages.
  >    
  >    The gold that changed life so suddenly for Alaska wassoon ended, and although many stories about mining camps have become part of American literature, the gold from Alaskan earth contributed less to economic progress than the fish from Alaska waters. The fish caught in a single year range in value from $80 million to $90 million. Fur-bearing animals are plentiful in the forests and streams, and valuable fur seals inhabit the waters. After fishing, the state's chief industry is lumber and the production of wood pulp. In recent years, Alaska' s single most important resource has become oil. The state also has large deposits of coal, copper , gold and other minerals.

  >     ~~~
  >       Hundreds of thousands of people supporting immigration rights in the US filled streets all over America in early 2006. Many held signs and American flags and asked to be treated as citizens—not criminals. Many of these supported legislation from Senator John McCain that would open a path to citizenship to immigrants who were already in the country illegally. Proposed legislation from other politicians called for stricter measures- including rounding up undocumented immigrants and sending them back to their home countries.
  >              Canadian officials say that immigration applications continue to rise. Some want to keep the doors open. They need the labor. About 400,000 immigrants were allowed into the country in 2005,according to the Canadian Government statistics. However, all this growth means that cities need to adapt. New comers don't always make a smooth transition into jobs for which they are skilled. So industries are using mentoring ( 辅导 ) programs to help new immigrants find proper jobs.
  >             With the large numbers of undocumented African immigrants arriving in the Canary Islands and showing no sign of abating (减少), the Spanish Government has decided to get tough. There will be no more mass amnesties (特赦) for illegals, and anyone coming to Spain without permission will be sent back, the government has announced. About 23,000 migrants (移民 ) landed on the islands in2006, and riots have erupted in some crowded reception centers. This has promoted local authorities to appeal to the United Nations for help. France's new immigration and integration law gives the government new powers to encourage high-skilled migration. It takes effect in 2007. The new law authorizes the government to identify particular professions where France has a talent shortage. Then the government will help these identified employers find immigrant workers with needed skills or qualifications. The selected foreign employees will be granted "skills and talents" visas, valid for three years. But some people show the concern that it'll cause brain drain in developing countries.

  > 12. The Workers Role in Management
  >
  >     ~~~
  >     Traditionally， it has been the worker's role to work and management's role to manage． Managers have planned and directed the firms operations with little thought of consulting the labor force． Managers have rarely felt forced to obtain the worker's opinions or to explain their decisions to their employees． At most， companies have provided "suggestion boxes" in which workers could place ideas for improving procedures． In recent years， however， many management specialists have been arguing that workers are more than sellers of labor-they have a vital stake（利害关系） in the company and may be able to make significant contributions to its management． Furthermore， major company decisions affect workers and their dependents． This is particularly true of plant closings， which may put thousands on the unemployment lines． Should workers， then， play a stronger role in management? Workers should have a role in management． At the very least， the labor force should be informed of major policy decisions． A common complaint among ordinary workers is the lack of information about company policies and actions． Between 1980 and 1985 about five million workers were the victims of plant closings and permanent layoffs（失业）， often with no warning． At least 90 days' notice ought to be given in such circumstances so that workers have time to adjust Management should consult workers before closing a plant， because the workers might be able to suggest ways of improving productivity and reducing costs and might be willing to make concessions（妥协） that will help keep the plant operating． It should become a general practice to include workers in some managerial decision making． There ought to be representatives of the workers on the firm's board of directors or other major policy-making groups． If ordinary workers are given a voice in the planning and management of the work flow， they will help to make improvements， their spirits will rise， and their productivity will increase． As a further incentive（激励）， they must be given a share in the company's profits． This can be done through employee stock ownership plans（员工持股计划）， bonuses， or rewards for efficiency and productivity． Finally， when a plant can no longer operate at a profit， the workers should be given the opportunity to purchase the plant and run it themselves．

  >     Television, the most pervasive and persuasive of modern technologies, marked by raid change and growth, is moving into a new era of extraordinary sophistication and versatility, which promises to reshape our lives and our world. It is an electronic revolution of sorts, made possible by the marriage of television and computer technologies.
  >     The word “television”，derived from its Greek (tele: distant) and Latin (vision: sight) roots, can literally be interpreted as sight from a distance. Very simply put, it works in this way: through a sophisticated system of electronics, television provides the capability of converting an image (focused on a special photoconductive plate within a camera) into electronic impulses, which can be sent through a wire or cable. These impulses, when fed into a receiver (television set), can then be electronically reconstituted into that same image.
  >     Television is more than just an electronic system, however. It is a means of expression, as well as a vehicle for communication, and as such becomes a powerful tool for reaching other human beings.
  >     The field of television can be divided into two categories determined by its means of transmission. First, there is broadcast television, which reaches the masses through broad-based airwave transmission of television signals. Second, there is non-broadcast television, which provides for the needs of individuals or specific interest groups through controlled transmission techniques.
  >     Traditionally, television has been a medium of the masses. We are most familiar with broadcast television because it has been with us for thirty seven years in a form similar to what exists today. During those years, it has been controlled, for the most pail, by the broadcast networks, ABC, NBC, and CBS, who have been the major purveyors of news, information, and entertainment. These giants of broadcasting have actually shaped not only television but our perception of it as well. We have come to look upon the picture tube as a source of entertainment, placing our role in this dynamic medium as the passive viewer.

  >       Modern science fiction writers don't write about men from Mars(火星)or space adventure stories．They are more interested in predicting the results of technical developments on society and the human mind; or in imagining future worlds that are a reflection of the world that we live in now．Because of this their writing has obvious political undertones(涵义).
  >       In an age where science fact frequently overtakes(超过)science fiction, the writers may find it difficult to keep ahead of scientific advances．Those who are sufficiently clearsighted to see the way we are going, however, may provide a valuable lesson on how to deal with the problems which society will inevitably face as it tries to master its new technology.

  >     You must be familiar with the situation: Dad's driving, Mum's telling him where to go.He's sure that they need to turn left. But she says it's not for another two blocks. Who has the better sense of direction Men or women.
  >     They both do, a new study says, but in different ways.
  >     Men and women,- Canadian researchers have found, have different methods of finding their way. Men look quickly at landmarks （地标） and head off in what they think is the right direction. Women, however, try to picture the whole route in detail and then follow the path in their head.
  >     'Women tend to be more detailed,' said Edward Cornell, who led the study, 'while men tend to be a little bit faster and...a little bit more intuitive （直觉感知的）.'
  >     In fact, said Cornell, 'sense of direction' isn't one skill but two.
  >     The first is the 'survey method'. This is when you see an area from above, such as a printed map. You can see, for example, where the hospital is, where the church is and that the supermarket is on its right.
  >     The second skill is the 'route method'. This is when you use a series of directions. You start from the hospital, then turn left, turn right, go uphill －and then you see the supermarket.
  >     Men are more likely to use the survey method while women are more likely to use one route and follow directions.Both work, and neither is better.

  >
  >     ~~~
  >     The Arctic is a polar region. It surrounds the North Pole. Like Antarctica, the Arctic is a land of ice and snow. Antarctica holds the record for a low temperature reading—125 Fahrenheit below zero. Readings of 85 degrees below zero are common in both the Arctic and Antarctica. Winter temperatures average 30 degrees below zero in the Arctic. At the South Pole the winter is about 73 degrees below zero. One thing alone makes it almost impossible for men to live in Antarctica and in parts of the Arctic. This one thing is the low temperature—the killing chill of the far North and the polar South. To survive, men must wear the warmest possible clothing. They must build windproof shelters. They must keep heaters going at all times. Not even for moment can they be unprotected against the below-zero temperature. Men have a way of providing for themselves. Polar explorers wrap themselves in warm coats and furs. The cold makes life difficult. But the explorers can stay alive. What about animals Can they survive Do we find plants Do we find life in the Arctic and the Antarctica Yes, we do. There is life in the oceans. There is life on land. Antarctica, as we have seen, is a cold place indeed. But this has not always been the case. Expedition scientists have discovered that Antarctica may have been much like our own. Explores have discovered coal in Antarctica. This leads them to believe that Antarctica at one time was a land of swamps and forests. Heat and moisture must have kept the trees in the forests alive

  > 17. The Beginning of Drama
  >
  >     ~~~
  >     there are many theories about the beginning of drama in ancient greece. the on most widely accepted today is based on the assumption that drama evolved from ritual. the argument for this view goes as follows. in the beginning, human beings viewed the natural forces of the world-even the seasonal changes-as unpredictable, and they sought through various means to control these unknown and feared powers. those measures which appeared to bring the desired results were then retained and repeated until they hardened into fied rituals. eventually stories arose which eplained or veiled the mysteries of the rites. as time passed some rituals were abandoned, but the stories, later called myths, persisted and provided material for art and drama.
  >     　　those who believe that drama evolved out of ritual also argue that those rites contained the seed of theater because music, dance, masks, and costumes were almost always used, furthermore, a suitable site had to be provided for performances and when the entire community did not participate, a clear division was usually made between the acting area and the auditorium. in addition, there were performers, and, since considerable importance was attached to avoiding mistakes in the enactment of rites, religious leaders usually assumed that task. wearing masks and costumes, they often impersonated other people, animals, or supernatural beings, and mimed the desired effect-success in hunt or battle, the coming rain, the revival of the sun-as an actor might. eventually such dramatic representations were separated from religious activities.
  >     　　　　another theory traces the theaters origin from the human interest in storytelling. according to this vies tales (about the hunt, war, or other feats) are gradually elaborated, at first through the use of impersonation, action, and dialogue by a narrator and then through the assumption of each of the roles by a different person. a closely related theory traces theater to those dances that are primarily rhythmical and gymnastic or that are imitations of animal movements and sounds.

  > 18. Soot and Snow；a Hot Combination
  >
  >     ~~~
  >     ①New research from NASA scientists suggests emissions（释放）of black soot alter the way sunlight reflects off snow. According to a computer simulation（模拟），black soot may be responsible for 25 percent of observed global warming over the past century.
  >     
  >     ②Soot in the higher latitudes（纬度）of the Earth，where ice is more common，absorbs more of the sun's energy and warmth than an icy，white background. Dark-colored black carbon，or soot，absorbs sunlight，while lighter colored ice reflects sunlight.
  >     
  >     ③Soot in areas with snow and ice may play an important role in climate change. Also，if snow and ice covered areas begin melting，the warming effect increases，as the soot becomes more concentrated on the snow surface. “This provides a positive feedback，as glaciers and ice sheet smelt，they tend to get even dirtier，" said Dr. James Hansen，a researcher at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies，New York.
  >     
  >     ④Hansen found soot’s effect on snow albedo（反照率）（solar energy reflected back to space），which may be contributing to trends toward early springs in the Northern Hemisphere，such as thinning Arctic sea ice，melting glaciers and permafrost（永冻层）.Soot also is believed to play a role in changes in the atmosphere above the oceans and land.
  >     
  >     ⑤”Black carbon reduces the amount of energy reflected by snow back into space，thus heating the snow surface more than if there were no black carbon，"Hansen said. Soot’s increased absorption of solar energy is especially effective in warming the world's climate. “This forcing is unusually effective，causing twice as much global warming as a carbon-dioxide（二氧化物）forcing of the same magnitude（量，大小），”Hansen noted.
  >     
  >     ⑥Hansen cautioned , although the role of soot in altering global climate is substantial , it does not alter the fact that greenhouse gases are the primary cause of climate warming during the past century. Such gases are expected to be the largest climate forcing for the rest of this century.
  >     
  >     ⑦The researchers found that observed warming in the Northern Hemisphere was large in the winter and spring at middle and high latitudes. These observations were consistent with the researchers ' climate model simulations, which showed some of the largest warming effects occurred when there were heavy snow cover and sufficient sunlight.

  > 19. The Disappearing Honeybee
  >
  >     ~~~
  >     Do you run away when you hear a bee buzzing? Many people do. A bee sting hurts and some people are allergic to bee venom. But did you know that bees are very important to humans? Honeybees do more than just make honey. They fly around and pollinate flowers, plants, and trees. Our fruits, nuts, and vegetables rely on these pollinators. One third of America's food supply is pollinated by the honeybee.
  >     
  >     Have you seen or heard a honeybee lately? Bees are mysteriously disappearing in many parts of the world. Most people don't know about this problem. It is called "colony collapse disorder" (CCD). Some North American beekeepers lost 80% of their hives from 2006-2008. Bees in Italy and Australia are disappearing too.
  >     
  >     The disappearance of the honeybee is a serious problem. Can you imagine never eating another blueberry? What about almonds and cherries? Without honeybees food prices will skyrocket. The poorest people always suffer the worst when there is a lack of food.
  >     
  >     This problem affects other foods besides fresh produce. Imagine losing your favourite ice cream! Haagen Daaz is a famous ice cream company. Many of their flavours rely on the hard working honeybee. In 2008, Haagen Daaz began raising money for CCD. They also funded a garden at the University of California called The Haven. This garden helps raise awareness about the disappearing honeybee and teaches visitors how to plant for pollinators.
  >     
  >     Donating money to research is the most important thing humans can do to save the honeybee. Scientists need money to investigate the causes of Colony Collapse Disorder. Some scientists blame CCD on climate change. Others think pesticides are killing the bees. Commercial bee migration may also cause CCD. Beekeepers transport their hives from place to place in order to pollinate plants year round.
  >     
  >     Not everyone has money to donate regularly. There are other ways to help the honeybee. Spread the word by telling your friends and family about the problem. Tell your teacher about the disappearing bees too. Maybe your class can write a letter to the government.

  >     There is no doubt that English is a useful language．The people who speak English today make up the largest speech community in the world with the exception of speakers of Chinese．2 A speech community is similar to other kinds of communities．The people who make up the community share a common language．Often they live side by side, as they do in a neighborhood (街坊)，a village，or a city．More often they form a whole country．National boundaries，however，are not always the same as the boundaries of a speech community．A speech community is any group of people who speak the same language no matter where they happen to live．3 We may say that anyone who speaks English belongs to the English speech community．For convenience(方便)，we may divide the speakers into two groups: one in which the speakers use English as their native language, the other in which the speakers 1earn English as a second language for the purpose of education，commerce，and so on．4 Learning a second language extends one’s vision and expands the mind．The history and literature of a second language record the real and fictional(虚构的)lives of people and their culture；a knowledge of them adds to our ability to understand and to feel as they feel．Learning English as a second language provides another means of communication through which the window of the entire English speech community becomes a part of our heritage．

  >     　　The United States is a sports-loving nation. Sports in America take a variety of forms: organized competitive struggles, which draw huge crowds to cheer their favorite team to victory; athletic games, played for recreation anywhere sufficient space is found; and hunting and fishing. Most sports are seasonal, so that what is happening in sports de-pends upon the time of year. Some sports are called spectator sports, as the number of spectators greatly exceeds the number playing in the game
  >     　　　　Baseball is the most popular sport in the US. It is played throughout the spring and summer, and professional baseball teams play well into the fall. Although no other game is exactly like baseball, perhaps the one most nearly like it is the English game of cricket.
  >     　　　　　　Football is the most popular sport in the fall. The game originated as a college sport more than 75 years ago. It is still played by almost every college and university in the country, and the football stadiums of some of the largest universities seat as many as 80,000 people. The game is not the same as European football or soccer. In American football there are 11 players on each team, and they are dressed in padded uniforms and helmets because the game is rough and injuries are likely to occur.
